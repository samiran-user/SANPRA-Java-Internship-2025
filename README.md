# Tasks Implemented
 --> Task 1 : Gussing Game

  Create a simple console game where the computer selects a random number between 1
  and 100. The user must guess the number, and the program provides hints ("Too High"
  or "Too Low"). Track the number of attempts and allow the user to play multiple rounds.

 --> Task 2 : Simple ATM Interface

  Develop a class-based system (using classes like Account and ATM) that simulates
  basic bank operations: checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing money. Data
  should be stored in memory (variables) and reset when the program ends. Focus on
  strong OOP design.
  
 --> Task 3 : StudentGradeTracker

  Implement a Java application using Collections (e.g., ArrayList or HashMap) to
  manage student records. Allow the user to add student names and grades, calculate the
  class average, and display the highest and lowest scores. Focus on Exception Handling
  for invalid input.
